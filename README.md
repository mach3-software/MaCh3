The Markov Chain 3 flavour is a framework born in 2013 as a Bayesian MCMC
fitter for [T2K](https://t2k-experiment.org/pl/) oscillation analysis. It has
now been used for multiple T2K Oscillation analyses at both the Near and Far
detectors throughout the years. The framework is also utilized by the
[DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org/) and [HK](https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/hk/)
oscillation analysis groups. Additionally, it supports joint fits between T2K
and NOvA, as well as T2K and SK's atmospheric data.

The framework has also evolved to allow non-MCMC modules to interrogate the
likelihoods implemented.

## Cite
When citing MaCh3, please use [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7608367) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13642670.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13642670).

## How to Compile
MaCh3 follows standard cmake pattern. By default you should get most optimal build setting although below we list many configurable options:
```bash
mkdir build;
cd build;
cmake ../
make -jN [Where N is number of threads]
make install
```

Don't forget to:
```bash
source bin/setup.MaCh3.sh
```
## Building against MaCh3
To include MaCh3 in your cmake project you can use following syntax
```cmake
CPMFindPackage(
  NAME MaCh3
  GIT_TAG "blarb"
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY mach3-software/MaCh3
)
```
Where "blarb" is the MaCh3 version. You can find a list of releases [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/wiki/0.1.-History)  
If you compiled MaCh3 and sourced it you can simply call
```cmake
find_package(MaCh3)
```

Once you found MaCh3 you might want to link your library against MaCh3. You can do this as follows:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(blarb MaCh3::All)
```

Some functionalities rely on setting `Env{MACH3}` which should point to path experiment specific MaCh3. This way MaCh3 can easily find `Env{MACH3}/inputs/SomeInput.root` for example.

## Python

MaCh3 can be compiled with a python interface by specifying the cmake option
```bash
cmake ../ -DMaCh3_PYTHON_ENABLED=ON
make && make install
```

Currently the python module only contains an interface to the plotting library (see [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/blob/develop/plotting/README.md#python) for more information on how to use it)


### Building with Pip

Additionally, you can build just the Python module by doing:

```bash
pip install -t <install location> .
```
The -t option specifies an install location which can be useful if you are on a computing cluster and don't have write access to the default install location. If you specify a non-standard location you will need to add it to your `PYTHONPATH` as above so that python can find the module.

## Multithreading
MaCh3 quite heavily relies on Multithreading, it is turned on by default. If for debugging purposes you would like to turn it off please use
```bash
cmake ../ -DMaCh3_MULTITHREAD_ENABLED=OFF
```

## CUDA
If the system has access to GPU, MaCh3 will enable GPU functionality automatically. If you would like to CPU only despite having access to [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
```bash
mkdir build; cd build;
cmake ../ -DUSE_CPU=ON
```
MaCh3 supports quite a high range of CUDA architectures if something doesn't work on your GPU let us know. MaCh3 supports only NVIDIA GPUs.

## Oscillator
MaCh3 uses several neutrino oscillation calculators.

Following neutrino oscillation calculators are available:
|Oscillator        | Hardware   | Source     | Reference  |
|------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| CUDAProb3Linear  | CPU/GPU    | Beam       |            |
| CUDAProb3        | CPU/GPU    | Atm        | [Ref](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.07.022)        |
| ProbGPULinear    | GPU        | Beam       | [Ref](http://dx.doi.org/10.3204/DESY-PROC-2014-05/23)   |
| Prob3++Linear    | CPU        | Beam       |            |
| NuFastLinear     | CPU        | Beam       | [Ref](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.02400)        |

If nothing is specified in cmake build then CUDAProb3Linear will be used. To control which oscillation calculators you want to use here is syntax:

```bash
cmake ../ -DCUDAProb3Linear_ENABLED=ON -DCUDAProb3_ENABLED=ON -DProbGPULinear_ENABLED=ON -DProb3ppLinear_ENABLED=ON -DNuFastLinear_ENABLED=ON
```
You can only specify engines you want to use, and you can in principle use more than one.

## Fitting algorithms
The following fitting algorithms are available:

| Algorithm  | Reference        |Need Ext Lib  |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| MR2T2      | [Ref](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1699114)       | No       |
| MINUIT2    | [Ref](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2296388/)     | Yes      |
| PSO        | [Ref](https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_r_00180)    | No       |


## Debug
Several debugging options are available which are heavy for RAM and performance and, therefore not used by default. To enable it:
```bash
cmake ../ -DMaCh3_DEBUG_ENABLED=<ON,OFF>
```
There are several debug modes, to enable more detailed but very heavy specific debug levels. Level 1 is the default debug activated by the above.

```bash
cmake ../ -DMaCh3_DEBUG_ENABLED=<ON,OFF> -DDEBUG_LEVEL=<1,2,3>
```
## System Requirements
Most of external libraries are being handled through [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake). The only external library that is not being handled through [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) and is required is [ROOT](https://root.cern/). Currently used external dependencies include:

1. [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
2. [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)

Based on several test here are recommended version:
```bash
  GCC: >= 8.5 [lower versions may work]
  CMake: >= 3.14
  ROOT: >= 6.18
```

## Plotting and Diagnostic
Example of chain diagnostic utils can be found [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/tree/develop/Diagnostics) with example of config.
The MaCh3 core plotting library code can be found [here](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3/tree/develop/plotting) along with example config files and some apps for making standard plots.

## How To Use
This is an example how your executable can look like using MaCh3:
```cpp
  manager *fitMan = nullptr; //Manager is responsible for reading from config

  std::vector<samplePDFBase*> sample; //vector storing information about sample for different detector
  std::vector<covarianceBase*> Cov; // vector with systematic implementation
  mcmc *markovChain = nullptr; // MCMC class, can be replaced with other fitting method
  MakeMaCh3Instance(fitMan, sample, Cov, markovChain); //Factory like function which initialises everything

  //Adding samples and covariances to the Fitter class could be in the factory
  for(unsigned int i = 0; sample.size(); i++)
    markovChain->addSamplePDF(sample[i]);
  for(unsigned int i = 0; Cov.size(); i++)
    markovChain->addSystObj(Cov[i]);

  markovChain->RunLLHScan(); // can run LLH scan
  markovChain->runMCMC(); //or run actual fit
```
