## Introduction
Welcome to %MaCh3!

This is the Reference Guide of the MaCh3 software.

If you are new we recommend to start from our [Tutorial](https://github.com/mach3-software/MaCh3Validations).
It is using dummy experiment and allow to easily and fast test most of MaCh3 functionality.

We also recommend getting familiar with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian analysis.
References and basic instructions are available in our \ref UserGuide "User Guide"

To better understand how the high-level interface works, see the
<a href="modules.html">Interface modules</a>.

If you are unsure in which release a particular feature was introduced,
please consult the \ref ReleaseNotes "Release Notes".

If you are looking for analyses performed with MaCh3 or related papers,
see the \ref ResultsPublications "Results and Publications" page.

MaCh3 also comes with a Python interface. You can find out more about this in the dedicated [pyMaCh3 documentation](./pyMaCh3/mainpage.html)

## About us
The Markov Chain 3 flavour is a framework born in 2013 as a Bayesian MCMC fitter for [T2K](https://t2k-experiment.org/pl/) oscillation analysis. It has now been used for multiple T2K Oscillation analyses both at the Near and Far detectors throughout the years and is also used by the DUNE and HK oscillation analysis groups as well as for joint fits between T2K and NOvA and T2K and SK's atmospheric data.

The framework has also evolved to allow non MCMC modules to interrogate the likelihoods implemented.
