## Versioning of this package

This package will follow this numbering convention for releases
- Major `X.0.0` for paradigm-shifting breaking changes
- Minor `0.X.0` for more minor breaking changes (or lots of non-breaking changes + a long time since last release)
- Patch `0.0.X` for non-breaking changes
